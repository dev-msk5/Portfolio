These basic projects were written as follows:
  Done the 1st Coursera ML specialization course from Andrew Ng and decided to implement what I have learned, stricly with Numpy and the basic python modules
  I used MLLs to make the data generator functions, after that I relied on myself and the course's collection of Jupyter notebooks for each model
  After I coded the model, I used matplotlib to plot the useful graphs
  Lastly, I asked LLMs to improve my code, thats how I recognized the importance of vectorization, so from the 1st project I used those instead of loops. which made my code way more efficient
