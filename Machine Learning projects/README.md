A few words about these projects

Most of these projects are meant to actually deploy my knowledge of python and Machine Learning, the source being Andrew Ng's fantastic courses and general books about ML and it's underlying math.
The development of these small-medium sized projects usually looked like this:
  1. Get the idea, of course
  2. Generate the dataset using LLMs, using matplotlib
  3. Actual programming
    3.1 Trying to implement the parts of the model
    3.2 Debugging and problem solving by myself
    3.3 If all else fails ask copilot, then understand why it tried to solve it in the given way
    3.4 Repeat until model is good
  4. SHow results with matplotlib
  5. Congrats, you're done!

  There were some quicker, some longer ones, but all in all I'm satisfied with how this repo will slowly become into what I have destined it to be. This is not the end of these projects, rather the beginning.
  After all, theory will only take us so far.

  Thanks for actually reading this :)
